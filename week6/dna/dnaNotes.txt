Specs:

- Check for command-line usage
    - First command-line argument
        - Name of a CSV file containing the STR counts for a list of individuals
    - Second command-line argument
        - Name of a text file containing the DNA sequence to identify

- Read database file into a Variable
    - Open te CSV file and read its contents into memory
        - We will read the contents into a list called database
        - Each row read from the CSV file is returned as a list of strings

- Read DNA sequence file into a variable
    - Open the DNA sequence file and read its contents into memory

- Find longest match of each STR in DNA sequence
    - Need to store the subsequences into a list
    - Need to read the DNA sequence and look for the longest sequence of each subsequence
    - Store the results in the dictionary

- Check database for matching profiles
    - Need to check each person's STR count in the database dictionary
    - If there is a match between the STR count of the DNA sample and person, we will add 1 to match
