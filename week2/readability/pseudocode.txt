User to input some text

Program tells the user the reading level of the text, based on the formula below:
index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8

L = Number of letters per 100 words
S = Number of sentences per 100 words

We need to count the number of:
Words
Letters
Sentences

Calculate the Grade Level

Notes:

A string is just an array of characters
    To find out how many letters are in the text, we need to loop each character checking whether or not it is a letter.

Need to count words in text.
    Will need to build logic to count the words.
    Not a dedicated function in C to do so.

Words are separated by spaces, so we can count the spaces and add one to account for final word in text.
    ex.         David is my friend.
        Spaces = 3
        Words  = 4

Need to count number of sentences in text.
    Can count number of full stops in text to determine number of sentences.
        Full stops (Periods)
        Question Marks
        Exclaimation Marks
