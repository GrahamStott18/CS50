For a brief demonstration video follow the link above.
## Description:
This is my final project for the Harvard CS50x course.

This project is a web application built on flask framework that allows users to send, receive, and view email messages. Users are required to register an email address and password to access webpage. Once registered/logged in users are able to view previously sent and received messages that have been stored to the database. Users can also reply to received emails and view replys.

All data is housed in the project.db file. This file stores the users account details such as emails and passwords for login. It also stores details of the email messages that are sent and received between users. The email details stored are sender, recipient, subject, body, and time stamp of each message sent on the webpage.

This project has been created using HTML, Python, and CSS.
